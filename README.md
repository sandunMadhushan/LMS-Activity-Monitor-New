## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Scraper Issues (GitHub Actions)

- Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
- Make sure credentials are correct in GitHub Secrets
- Verify Moodle sites are accessible
- Chrome/ChromeDriver are automatically installed by the workflow

### Email Issues

- Verify Gmail app password is correct
- Check if 2FA is enabled on your Google Account
- Use App Passwords (not your regular password)
- Check spam folder for notifications

### Mobile Notification Issues

- **Check Ntfy App**: Ensure you're subscribed to the correct topic in the app
- **Test Topic**: Run `curl -d "Test message" ntfy.sh/your-topic-name` - if you receive this on your phone, the topic works!
- **Verify `.env`**: Ensure `NTFY_TOPIC` matches your app subscription exactly
- **Check Server**: Default is `https://ntfy.sh` (no trailing slash)
- **GitHub Actions**: Add `NTFY_TOPIC` to repository secrets for automated notifications

**📖 See [`docs/NTFY_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](docs/NTFY_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed troubleshooting.**

### GitHub Actions Issues

- Check Actions tab for error logs
- Verify all 8 secrets are set correctly (including `NTFY_TOPIC`)
- Ensure repository has write permissions enabled
- Database commits require `permissions: contents: write` (already configured)

### Cloud Deployment Issues

**Railway:**

- Check Railway dashboard → Deployments → View Logs
- Verify environment variables are set in Variables tab
- Railway uses dynamic PORT (auto-detected by app)
- Scan button disabled (correct - GitHub Actions handles this)

**Render:**

- Check Render dashboard logs for errors
- Verify `runtime.txt` specifies Python 3.11.9
- Database is tracked in git (not blocked by .gitignore)
- Scan button disabled (correct - GitHub Actions handles this)

**If Both Are Slow:**

- Use whichever loads faster at the moment
- Both platforms use the same database from GitHub
- Consider running locally: `python app.py`

### Calendar Sync Issues

- Check that deadlines exist in the database
- Calendar events are stored in the `deadlines` table with `source='calendar'`
- Duplicate events are automatically prevented
- Delete old calendar events manually if needed: `DELETE FROM deadlines WHERE source='calendar'`

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ Never commit `.env` file (already in .gitignore)
- ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for all sensitive data
- ✅ Credentials are encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- ✅ Database is public but contains no sensitive info (only course metadata)
- ✅ Use Gmail App Passwords (not your main password)
- ✅ Repository can be private if needed (GitHub Actions work on private repos)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs (Actions tab)
2. Review Railway or Render deployment logs (dashboard)
3. Check error messages in email notifications
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`requirements.txt`)
5. Verify Moodle sites are accessible from your network
6. See detailed docs in `docs/` folder

## 🚀 Recent Updates
